                    <h5>
                        It’s important for all educators to think about how to differentiate their instruction in order to meet the needs of their students. Students need plenty of opportunities to feel success while still being challenged daily. Throughout the year, I have taken every opportunity I could get to challenge or scaffold my teaching to certain students.  I have found this easiest to implement during rotations where the students are grouped according to their abilities.  The more I have gotten to know my students, the easier to has become to differentiate because I also have a better idea of what their interests are and how to capture their attention more quickly.  In the future, I would like to take more time in the beginning of the year to get to know and connect with my students so that the differentiation process can happen from the beginning.

                    <h5>
                        To me, this is the cherry on top of the sundae and the missing piece in the puzzle of teaching. Teachers are always so concerned with having their students create beautiful and meaningful work, which is of course important, but teaching children to appreciate and enjoy the learning process and the present moment, is for me, a beautiful different perspective to take.  Focusing on this inquiry has helped me be more present with my students and bring myself back to the present moment when I notice my mind wonder toward upcoming lessons or deadlines.  I feel like I am now at a place where I laugh more with my students and really just enjoy being together!

                    <h5>
						My classroom management has improved tremendously this year and is definitely the thing I am most proud of! What I found to be most helpful is clearly stating my expectations often and having my students practice transitions so they feel confident in what they do. Being consistent is imperative when it comes to implementing consequences and rewarding and reinforcing positive behavior is a must in my book. With my overarching goal being to improve my classroom management model, I would now confidently say I have more tools in my teaching tool box that help me with this. As a teacher, it is important to start the year with a firm mindset and with the patience to know that classroom management is a work in progress. It is a process of trial and error and I have reflected often on my classroom management throughout the year and tried new things to see what works best. Praising positive behavior, recognizing when a child is truly in need of attention, being consistent with my behavior expectations, and having the class practice transitions to make them smooth and seamless are several things that have helped my class tremendously this year.

						Before the school year begins, I would advise all teachers to devise a plan on how to keep a good work life balance. This would look different for everyone- but some good things to keep in mind are what your personal warning signs look like when you are over extending yourself.  Personally, I have had to set a boundary when it comes to replying to work related emails and in doing work on the weekends.  I also have made a point to get in self-care and to prioritize getting things done outside of work when it is necessary.  It’s so easy to burn out and feel exhausted when you put work above everything else!  As teachers, there is always more for us to get done.  We need to pace ourselves and enjoy the journey.  This is a learning process for all of us!

                    </h3>
					<h5>
                        At the beginning of the year, Gabi came into the classroom slowly and tentatively.  It was visible she had little confidence and she didn’t speak much. English is her second language and her parents told me she was struggling with speaking in front of the class and making friends. 
					</h5>
                    <h5>
                        This was the perfect opportunity for me to rethink the way I run my classroom.  I have a morning circle every day and I knew this was a great time to have a safe place where Gabi and all of my students could work on building their confidence and self esteem.  I structured the circle in such a way where all of my students could have jobs that they felt successful at which would help build their confidence as well. Whether they are calendar leader, reporting the weather as meteorologist, or leading the class in counting days of school- each job provides the students with an opportunity to speak.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        Gabi now beams with confidence when she is up in front of  her peers!  She absolutely loves being in front of the class!  She often encourages her classmates to get involved and become enthused when we are having music time and helps them get their needs met.  The consistency and predictability of the class jobs and of what to say helped her so much!

However, during the learning process, we are constantly making mistakes along the way and learning from them. Mistakes should be celebrated! They are in my classroom.
